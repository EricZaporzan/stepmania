StepMania
=========

##Repository forked by Eric Zaporzan##
I forked this project for modifications for the purposes of a Human-Computer Interaction experiment at the University of Toronto. Many thanks to the creators and contributors. The idea is to modify the code to play a feedback noise whenever a key is pressed, and possibly to add more metrics to measure effectiveness of play. If you're looking for the true StepMania experience, look [here](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania)!

- The MAD library and FFmpeg codecs when built with the code use the GPL license.
